abstract: Federal tax law provides tax-exemptions for nonprofit hospitals in exchange for community benefit provisions. The one of the justifications for tax-exempt status has been known as “community benefits standard”, which has been evolved over the years. The current idea of community benefit standard is that tax-exempt nonprofit hospitals are expected to promote the health of public or community to be charitable. In the meantime, nonprofit hospitals do not generally receive special treatment in antitrust law cases which might increase market power of nonprofit hospitals. An important problem with the community benefit standard is the inconsistency between the rationale of tax exemption to nonprofit hospitals and federal antitrust law approach to nonprofit hospitals. In this paper, I test the hypothesis that nonprofit hospitals provide more community benefits once they acquire more market power and find that there is no statistically significant evidence on the effect of hospital and insurer competition on the community benefit provision of nonprofit hospitals. Taking into account of insurer competition, nonprofit hospitals do not benefit their communities more with more market power.
