It is not news anymore that Medicare has been experimenting with new payment models in health care to transform the health care delivery system. Transition to value-based payments from traditional fee-for-service payments has been under way more than a decade. I believe that the time has come to evaluate the impact of the value-based program on health outcomes in a comprehensive study or studies, which is not an undemanding job for a blog post. In this post, I'll discuss the social risk factor calculation in Medicare payments. Does the calculation do a good job to measure socioeconomic factors of communities?

What is the social risk factor(SRF)? Is it different from social determinants of health? The semantic issue of what-is or what-is-not seems to have occupied the literature about the distinction between SRFs and social determinants of health[^1]. Simply, SRFs insinuate that patients have adverse and non-medical social risks that cause poor health. SRFs act as a proxy to picture the socioeconomic status of patients along with their characteristics[^2] and give us an idea about social determinants of health at the public level. I guess the question (of) whether incorporating the risk adjustment for SRFs into payment models does a good job for health inequalities is more important than the semantic difference between the SRFs and social determinants of health. 

My take on this problem is that the rationale behind the idea of the alignment of payment models with aims to address SDOH or social risk factors is without a theoretical foundation. As a researcher with an interest in SDOH, I haven't been convinced that health providers could improve the social determinants of health of their communities or targeted patient populations from a theoretical point of view. The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) report to Congress in 2016 mainly supports my main opinion in this regard[^3]. 

When I asked a development economist from an Ivy school what she thought about social determinants of health, she mentioned that all she could think of was nothing more than a poverty problem. The concept of SDOH is for mostly about the improvement of environment in where people live and work or non-medical factors that might be linked to health outcomes, but eventually it's true that SDOH is inherently a poverty problem. As the concept of scarcity trap shows, to some extent, the problem could be a cognitive issue. If that's the case, it would not be a simple task to conduct SDOH interventions to improve health inequalities in vulnerable populations.

In the next post, I will discuss some upstream SDOH interventions that actually work to address SDOH.
