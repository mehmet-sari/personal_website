I extensively summarize my dissertation research in this blog post. In my research, I explore two questions: 

    1. Does hospital market power affect the provision level of community benefits?

    2. Does the quality of charity care change with more hospital market power? 

Why are these questions worth to study? to answer the question we need to delve into tax exemption status of nonprofit hospitals bu not too deeply. Nonprofit hospitals in the United States are the largest nonprofit sector and account for 56% of non-government, community hospitals in 2018 according to American Hospital Association.[^1] Those hospitals are exempted from federal, state, and local taxes and retain the tax exemption status in exchange of providing community benefits. Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code specifies in detail the requirements of nonprofit status and sets forth the exempt purposes for the qualification.

The tax-exemption status justification has been evolved since the enactment of Medicaid and Medicare as a national public health insurance in 1965 even though Federal tax law provides tax-exemption status for nonprofit organizations since the beginning of federal taxation in 1913. Previously, IRS expected nonprofit hospitals to provide health care services to those in need for free or at the rates below-cost services. This standard was called as "charity care standard". The introduction of Medicaid and Medicare reduced the need of charity care since the national public health insurance decreased the uninsured rate. Later, IRS expanded the standard and described it as “that the hospital benefits the community it serves through the promotion of health” and “it is operated to serve a public rather than a private interest”. The standard is now called "community benefit standard".

An important problem with community benefit standard is the inconsistency between the rationale of tax exemption to nonprofit hospitals and federal antitrust law approach to nonprofit hospitals. Federal tax law exempts nonprofit hospitals from federal taxes so nonprofit hospitals could benefit their communities. As a possible advantage in competitive health care market, tax-exemption status provide indirect subsidies to nonprofit hospitals. One may expect that nonprofit hospitals might provide more community benefits with better financial health and more market power. Increasing market power in health care market through mergers and acquisitions, nonprofit hospitals can provide more community benefits.  However, federal antitrust departments do not differentiate nonprofit hospitals from for-profit hospitals in antitrust cases. 

Another inconsistency occurred within the IRS. A memorandum from the General Counsel of the IRS in 1991 issues a contradictory position to IRS's policy toward the community benefit standard.  The General Counsel Memoranda examines a series hospital-physician joint ventures and concludes that “Obtaining referrals or avoiding new competition may improve the competitive position of an individual hospital, but that is not necessarily the same as benefitting its community. 









[^1]: The percentage of nonprofit hospitals compared to for-profit hospitals has been declining over the years; however, more than half of all hospitals are still nonprofit hospitals.
