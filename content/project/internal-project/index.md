In this project, I aim to examine how to calculate medicare reimbursement payments to each medicare hospital using [CMS Cost Reports](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports) and [Medicare Provider Utilization and Public Use File](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient)  data and create an automated application written in python. The ultimate objective is to understand the complexity of CMS payment models and how proposed payment models would change the reimbursement and therefore health outcomes.
