abstract: Nonprofit hospitals with tax-exemption status are expected to promote the health of their communities to retain the tax-exemption status. Nonprofit hospitals report information regarding their financial assistance and certain other community benefit activities in dollar value during that tax year on Schedule H, which is attached to Form 990. Either the IRS or hospitals do not observe whether the community benefit activities do promote the community's health. Secondly, as a favorable tax treatment, nonprofit hospitals are expected to provide more community benefit provision once they acquire more market power or financial ability. In this paper, I examine whether the healthcare market concentration impacts the health of communities through the community benefit provisions of nonprofit. I use prevention quality indicators at population level as an outcome of interest to study the research question. Using IRS Form 990 and HCUP State Inpatient Database (SID) files for six states from 2012 and 2016, I find no evidence that nonprofit hospitals promote their communities through community benefit provisions in more concentrated markets. Unlike the hospital competition, I find evidence that prevention quality indicators improve in more concentrated insurer markets.
